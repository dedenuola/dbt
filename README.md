# DBT BigQuery Project
## Elevating Data Transformation

### Introduction
Welcome to my DBT BigQuery Project. In this initiative, I will showcase my ability to leverage data transformation tools to model and analyze datasets effectively within Google BigQuery. This project serves as a demonstration of my expertise in utilizing modern data engineering techniques, aiming to derive meaningful insights, facilitate efficient data collection, and ensure a seamless transition in the realm of data analytics. Join me as we navigate the complexities of data modeling and analytics through the lens of DBT and BigQuery.

### Overview
DBT (data build tool) is a command-line tool that enables data analysts and engineers to transform data in their warehouse more effectively. By building models and executing transformations directly in a SQL-based environment, DBT allows for enhanced data accessibility and analysis.

In this project, I focus on creating models related to customer data and order transactions. The end goal is to facilitate data quality assurance, improve accessibility, and create a robust framework for ongoing data analysis. This project highlights the potential of DBT to manage transformations efficiently while ensuring data integrity through various testing methodologies.

### Architecture & Technologies
This architectural framework ensures a streamlined, automated, and scalable approach to handling data, from its extraction to transformation and analysis.

- **DBT**: For data modeling and transformation.
- **Google BigQuery**: Cloud-based data warehouse for storing and querying large datasets.
- **Git**: Version control system to manage code changes and collaborate.
- **CI/CD Tools**: To automate the deployment of changes and ensure quality in the pipeline.

### How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <project_directory>


### Result
The result of this project will be a set of well-defined models that provide insights into customer and order data, enabling better decision-making and analysis.
